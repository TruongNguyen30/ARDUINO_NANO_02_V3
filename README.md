# ARDUINO_NANO_02_V3
This is a custom-designed PCB implementation of the classic Arduino Nano V3.0.  The project aims to modernize the original design by replacing the outdated Mini-USB port with a robust **USB-C connector**, while maintaining full pin compatibility with the standard Nano footprint.
