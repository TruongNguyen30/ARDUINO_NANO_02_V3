# ARDUINO_NANO_02_V3
This is a custom-designed PCB implementation of the classic Arduino Nano V3.0.  The project aims to modernize the original design by replacing the outdated Mini-USB port with a robust **USB-C connector**, while maintaining full pin compatibility with the standard Nano footprint.

## Key Features
* **Microcontroller:** ATmega328P (TQFP package).
* **Connectivity:** Upgraded to **USB-C** interface for reliable power and data transmission.
* **Compatibility:** 100% pin-compatible with standard Arduino Nano, perfectly fits on breadboards.
* **Power:** On-board 5V and 3.3V voltage regulators.
* **Programming:** Includes ICSP header for external programming or bootloader burning.

## PCB Design
* **Layers:** 2-Layer PCB.
* **Dimensions:** Standard Nano size.
* **Layout:** Optimized trace routing with ground plane for noise reduction.
